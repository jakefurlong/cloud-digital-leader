# Section 1: Digital Transformation with Google Cloud (~17% of the exam)

## 1.1 - Why Cloud Technology is Transforming Business

Explain why and how the cloud is revolutionizing businesses.

- Define the terms: cloud, cloud technology, data, digital transformation, cloud-native, open source, open standard.
  - Cloud: A cloud refers to a model of computing that delivers on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources such as compute, storage, and networking. It provides flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, catering to diverse organizational needs and business goals.

  - Cloud Technology: the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), as services over the internet. It eliminates the need for individuals and businesses to self-manage physical resources themselves, and only pay for what they use.

  - Data: data is a collection of facts, information, and statistics and this can be in various forms such as numbers, text, sound, images, or any other format.

  - Digital Transformation: when an organization takes advantage of new technologies to redesign and redefine relationships with their customers, employees, and partners.

  - Cloud-Native: an approach to building and running scalable applications to take full advantage of cloud-based services and delivery models.

  - Open Source: a decentralized production model that allows anyone to modify and share technology because its design is publicly accessible.
    - Source: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/open-source/
  - Open Standard: a standard that is freely available for adoption, implementation and updates.

- Describe the differences between cloud technology and traditional or on-premises technology.
  - Cloud computing differs from traditional on-premises IT primarily in flexibility, cost, and management. On-premises requires significant upfront investment in hardware and software, with in-house teams handling maintenance, security, and scaling. In contrast, cloud computing operates on a pay-as-you-go model, offering scalable, internet-based services managed by third-party providers, which reduce maintenance burdens and enhance accessibility. While on-premises offers more control and can be better for strict compliance needs, cloud solutions excel in adaptability and cost efficiency.
